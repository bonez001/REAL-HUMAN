<h2>📖 Chapter 0: <strong>In the Beginning, There Was the Prompt</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
  “Before there were functions, there were dreams. Before code, there was chaos. And then… Python.”
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>🐍 First, Let's Meet Python (The Language, Not the Snake)</h3>

<p>Python is a programming language that is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple</li>
  <li>Clean</li>
  <li>Not JavaScript (bless)</li>
  <li>Perfect for beginners, dreamers, and people who write poetry in <code>.py</code> files</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>print("Hello, World")</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. That’s real Python. You’ve just spoken to the computer in its own weird dialect. And it didn’t scream.</p>

<p>Python is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interpreted</strong>: it reads your code one line at a time</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong>: variables are chill until they’re not</li>
  <li><strong>Readable</strong>: it looks like English if English had indentation anxiety</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>🤖 Enter AI, Stage Left</h3>

<p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the wizard behind the curtain—except the curtain is your code editor, and the wizard really wants to autocomplete everything you say.</p>

<p>Inside Cursor AI, there's a Large Language Model (LLM). A <em>what now</em>?</p>

<h3>🧠 LLM = Big Nerd Trained on All the Text</h3>

<p>A <strong>Large Language Model</strong> is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trained on billions of words</li>
  <li>Predicts what comes next in a sentence</li>
  <li>So good at completing code it sometimes gaslights you</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not really thinking. It’s just <strong>very good at pattern recognition</strong>. Like a parrot that read Stack Overflow and became sentient.</p>

<hr>

<h3>🎩 What’s a Prompt?</h3>

<p>In LLM land, a <strong>prompt</strong> is just:</p>

<blockquote>“What you type to get the AI to do something weird, brilliant, or both.”</blockquote>

<pre><code># Write a function that tells me a dad joke</code></pre>

<pre><code># Refactor this to be cooler, like maybe use a list comprehension or vibes</code></pre>

<pre><code># Explain this like I'm five and scared of recursion</code></pre>

<p>A good prompt is like casting a spell.<br>
A bad prompt is like mumbling into a fax machine.<br>
Either way, <strong>Cursor AI</strong> tries its best.</p>

<hr>

<h3>💬 But… How Do I <em>Prompt</em> in Cursor?</h3>

<p><strong>Here’s the twist:</strong><br>
I'm not going to tell you. 😈</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because the very <em>first</em> lesson of working with AI is this:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Learn how to ask questions.</strong></blockquote>

<p>So here’s your first quest:</p>

<p>🧙‍♂️ Open up <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, and ask it:</p>

<pre><code>How do I enter a prompt in Cursor AI to generate code?</code></pre>

<p>If you succeed, Cursor shall open its magical interface to you.<br>
If not… well, try again. This is programming now. Welcome to the infinite loop.</p>

<hr>

<h3>✨ What This Book Will Do</h3>

<p>You’ll learn to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code with Python (intuitively, weirdly, joyfully)</li>
  <li>Prompt like a poet with a keyboard</li>
  <li>Build real things using Cursor AI as your coding sidekick</li>
  <li>Break, fix, and laugh at your own bugs</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not a tutorial. This is a <strong>buddy-cop movie</strong>, starring:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You</strong> (the curious human)</li>
  <li><strong>Cursor AI</strong> (the slightly overeager robot sidekick)</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, you’ll:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make apps</li>
  <li>Write scripts</li>
  <li>Call APIs</li>
  <li>Store secrets (like snacks and sadness)</li>
  <li>And eventually build a project so good, you’ll frame your own GitHub profile</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>🧃 TL;DR</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong>: clean, simple, powerful, doesn’t bite (usually)</li>
  <li><strong>AI</strong>: the autocomplete spirit haunting your editor</li>
  <li><strong>LLM</strong>: the brain behind the bot, trained on the entire internet and your dreams</li>
  <li><strong>Prompts</strong>: the way you speak to the machine</li>
  <li><strong>Cursor AI</strong>: the editor that turns prompts into power</li>
  <li><strong>You</strong>: the meat wizard who makes it all work</li>
</ul>
